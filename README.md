# Pixel Animation Effect

This project implements a pixel animation effect using HTML canvas and JavaScript. It features pixelated cells that animate across the canvas, responding to mouse movements and creating dynamic visual effects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:itsmepvr/Pixel-Animation.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- Hover your mouse over the canvas to interact with the pixelated cells.
- Experience dynamic animations and visual effects as the cells respond to mouse movements.

## Customization

- Mouse interaction parameters (`this.mouse.radius`).
- Canvas dimensions (`canvas.width` and `canvas.height`).
- Number of cells (`this.cellWidth` and `this.cellHeight` in the Effect class).
- Friction (`this.friction`).
- Ease (`this.ease`).
- NUMBER_OF_PIECES.
- Initial Position of peices (`this.positionX`, `this.positionY`).
- Randomise motion (`this.randomize`)
